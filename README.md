### Payment Providers

One can add new providers by copying existing one.

Currently supported providers:
- TF (Turkiye Finans), placed at `/src/payment-providers/tf.ts`.
- SIPAY ([Sipay](https://sipay.com.tr))

Note: Use only TypeScript files. JS files are temporary and built from TypeScript sources. Any change here should be built with `npm run build-pp`.
